The output will go to the value of kProfilingFile. | kProfilingAtStart |  | ../chromium/src/base/base_switches.cc |
| --profiling-file |  Specifies a location for profiling output. This will only work if chrome has  been built with the gyp variable profiling=1 or gn arg enable_profiling=true.     {pid} if present will be replaced by the pid of the process.    {count} if present will be incremented each time a profile is generated            for this process.

| --vmodule |  Gives the per-module maximal V-logging levels to override the value  given by --v.  E.g. "my_module=2,foo*=3" would change the logging  level for all code in source files "my_module.*" and "foo*.*"  ("-inl" suffixes are also disregarded for this matching).   Any pattern containing a forward or backward slash will be tested  against the whole pathname and not just the module.  E.g.,  "*/foo/bar/*=2" would change the logging level for all code in  source files under a "foo/bar" directory. | kVModule |  | ../chromium/src/base/base_switches.cc |

| --host-package-name |  When we retrieve the package name within the SDK Runtime, we need to use  a bit of a hack to do this by taking advantage of the fact that the pid  is the same pid as the application's pid + 10000.  see:  https:cs.android.com/android/platform/superproject/main/+/main:frameworks/base/core/java/android/os/Process.java;l=292;drc=47fffdd53115a9af1820e3f89d8108745be4b55d  When the render process is created however, it is just a regular isolated  process with no particular association so we can't perform the same hack.  When creating minidumps, the package name is retrieved from the process  meaning the render process minidumps would end up reporting a generic  process name not associated with the app.  We work around this by feeding through the host package information to the  render process when launching it. | kHostPackageName | BUILDFLAG(IS_ANDROID) | ../chromium/src/base/base_switches.cc |

| --disable-zero-browsers-open-for-tests |  Some tests seem to require the application to close when the last  browser window is closed. Thus, we need a switch to force this behavior  for ChromeOS Aura, disable "zero window mode".  TODO(pkotwicz): Investigate if this bug can be removed.  (http:crbug.com/119175) | kDisableZeroBrowsersOpenForTests |  | ../chromium/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc |

| --no-first-run |  Skip First Run tasks as well as not showing additional dialogs, prompts or  bubbles. Suppressing dialogs, prompts, and bubbles is important as this  switch is used by automation (including performance benchmarks) where it's  important only a browser window is shown.   This may not actually be the first run or the What's New page. Its effect can  be partially ignored by adding kForceFirstRun (for FRE), kForceWhatsNew (for  What's New) and/or kIgnoreNoFirstRunForSearchEngineChoiceScreen (for the DSE  choice screen). This does not drop the First Run sentinel and thus doesn't  prevent first run from occurring the next time chrome is launched without  this flag. It also does not update the last What's New milestone, so does not  prevent What's New from occurring the next time chrome is launched without  this flag. | kNoFirstRun |  | ../chromium/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc |

| --no-startup-window |  Does not automatically open a browser window on startup (used when  launching Chrome for the purpose of hosting background apps). | kNoStartupWindow |  | ../chromium/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc |
| --on-the-fly-mhtml-hash-computation |  Calculate the hash of an MHTML file as it is being saved.  The browser process will write the serialized MHTML contents to a file and  calculate its hash as it is streamed back from the renderer via a Mojo data  pipe. | kOnTheFlyMhtmlHashComputation |  | ../chromium/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc |
| --new-window |  Launches URL in new browser window. | kOpenInNewWindow |  | ../chromium/src/chrome/common/chrome_switches.cc |

| --virtual-time-budget |  If set the system waits the specified number of virtual milliseconds before  deeming the page to be ready.  For determinism virtual time does not advance  while there are pending network fetches (i.e no timers will fire). Once all  network fetches have completed, timers fire and if the system runs out of  virtual time is fastforwarded so the next timer fires immediately, until the  specified virtual time budget is exhausted. | kVirtualTimeBudget |  | ../chromium/src/components/headless/command_handler/headless_command_switches.cc |
| --subproc-heap-profiling |  Forces Heap Profiling on for a subprocess. The browser will add this when  the kHeapProfilerCentralControl feature is enabled and the subprocess should  be profiled. | kSubprocessHeapProfiling |  | ../chromium/src/components/heap_profiling/in_process/switches.cc |

| --enable-background-tracing |  Enables background tracing by passing a scenarios config as an argument. The  config is a serialized proto `perfetto.protos.ChromeFieldTracingConfig`  defined in  third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/config/chrome/scenario_config.proto.  protoc can be used to generate a serialized proto config with  protoc    --encode=perfetto.protos.ChromeFieldTracingConfig    --proto_path=third_party/perfetto/      third_party/perfetto/protos/perfetto/config/chrome/scenario_config.proto   < {input txt config}.pbtxt > {output proto config}.pb | kEnableBackgroundTracing |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --enable-legacy-background-tracing |  Enables background tracing by passing legacy trigger rules as an argument. | kEnableLegacyBackgroundTracing |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-config-file |  Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup.  This flag will be ignored if --trace-startup or --trace-shutdown is provided. | kTraceConfigFile |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-startup |  Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup. Optionally, can  specify the specific trace categories to include (e.g.  --trace-startup=base,net) otherwise, all events are recorded. Setting this  flag results in the first call to BeginTracing() to receive all trace events  since startup.   Historically, --trace-startup was used for browser startup profiling and  --enable-tracing was used for browsertest tracing. Now they are share the  same implementation, but both are still supported to avoid disrupting  existing workflows. The only difference between them is the default duration  (5 seconds for trace-startup, unlimited for enable-tracing). If both are  specified, 'trace-startup' takes precedence.   In Chrome, you may find --trace-startup-file and  --trace-startup-duration to control the auto-saving of the trace (not  supported in the base-only TraceLog component). | kTraceStartup |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --enable-tracing |  | kEnableTracing |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-config-handle |  Causes TRACE_EVENT flags to be recorded from startup, passing a SMB  handle containing the serialized perfetto config. This flag will be  ignored if --trace-startup or --trace-shutdown is provided. | kTraceConfigHandle |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-startup-duration |  Sets the time in seconds until startup tracing ends. If omitted:  - if --trace-startup is specified, a default of 5 seconds is used.  - if --enable-tracing is specified, tracing lasts until the browser is  closed. Has no effect otherwise. | kTraceStartupDuration |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-startup-file |  If supplied, sets the file which startup tracing will be stored into, if  omitted the default will be used "chrometrace.log" in the current directory.  Has no effect unless --trace-startup is also supplied.  Example: --trace-startup --trace-startup-file=/tmp/trace_event.log  As a special case, can be set to 'none' - this disables automatically saving  the result to a file and the first manually recorded trace will then receive  all events since startup. | kTraceStartupFile |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --enable-tracing-output |  Similar to the flag above, with the following differences:  - A more detailed basename will be generated.  - If the value is empty or ends with path separator, the provided directory  will be used (with empty standing for current directory) and a detailed  basename file will be generated.   It is ignored if --trace-startup-file is specified. | kEnableTracingOutput |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-startup-format |  Sets the output format for the trace, valid values are "json" and "proto".  If not set, the current default is "proto".  "proto", unlike json, supports writing the trace into the output file  incrementally and is more likely to retain more data if the browser process  unexpectedly terminates.  Ignored if "trace-startup-owner" is not "controller". | kTraceStartupFormat |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --enable-tracing-format |  | kEnableTracingFormat |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-startup-record-mode |  If supplied, sets the tracing record mode and options; otherwise, the default  "record-until-full" mode will be used. | kTraceStartupRecordMode |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-startup-owner |  Specifies the coordinator of the startup tracing session. If the legacy  tracing backend is used instead of perfetto, providing this flag is not  necessary. Valid values: 'controller', 'devtools', or 'system'. Defaults to  'controller'.   If 'controller' is specified, the session is controlled and stopped via the  TracingController (e.g. to implement the timeout).   If 'devtools' is specified, the startup tracing session will be owned by  DevTools and thus can be controlled (i.e. stopped) via the DevTools Tracing  domain on the first session connected to the browser endpoint.   If 'system' is specified, the system Perfetto service should already be  tracing on a supported platform (currently only Android). Session is stopped  through the normal methods for stopping system traces. | kTraceStartupOwner |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --perfetto-disable-interning |  Repeat internable data for each TraceEvent in the perfetto proto format. | kPerfettoDisableInterning |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-to-console |  Sends a pretty-printed version of tracing info to the console. | kTraceToConsole |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --background-tracing-output-path |  Sets a local folder destination for tracing data. This is only used if  kEnableBackgroundTracing is also specified. | kBackgroundTracingOutputPath |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --trace-smb-size |  Configures the size of the shared memory buffer used for tracing. Value is  provided in kB. Defaults to 4096. Should be a multiple of the SMB page size  (currently 32kB on Desktop or 4kB on Android). | kTraceSmbSize |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --default-trace-buffer-size-limit-in-kb |  This is only used when we did not set buffer size in trace config and will be  used for all trace sessions. If not provided, we will use the default value  provided in perfetto_config.cc | kDefaultTraceBufferSizeLimitInKb |  | ../chromium/src/components/tracing/common/tracing_switches.cc |
| --translate-script-url |  Overrides the default server used for Google Translate. | kTranslateScriptURL |  | ../chromium/src/components/translate/core/common/translate_switches.cc |

| --disable-variations-seed-fetch-throttling |  Disables throttling for fetching the variations seed on mobile platforms. The  seed will be fetched on startup and every time the app enters the foreground,  regardless of the time passed in between the fetches. On Desktop, this switch  has no effect (the seed is fetched periodically instead). | kDisableVariationsSeedFetchThrottling |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --enable-benchmarking |  TODO(asvitkine): Consider removing or renaming this functionality.  Enables the benchmarking extensions. | kEnableBenchmarking |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --enable-field-trial-config |  Enable field trial tests configured in fieldtrial_testing_config.json. If the  "disable_fieldtrial_testing_config" GN flag is set to true, then this switch  is a no-op. Otherwise, for non-Chrome branded builds, the testing config is  already applied by default, unless the "--disable-field-trial-config",  "--force-fieldtrials", and/or "--variations-server-url" switches are passed.  It is however possible to apply the testing config as well as specify  additional field trials (using "--force-fieldtrials") by using this switch.  For Chrome-branded builds, the testing config is not enabled by default, so  this switch is required to enable it. | kEnableFieldTrialTestingConfig |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --fake-variations-channel |  Fakes the channel of the browser for purposes of Variations filtering. This  is to be used for testing only. Possible values are "stable", "beta", "dev"  and "canary". This works for official builds as well. | kFakeVariationsChannel |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --force-fieldtrial-params |  This option can be used to force parameters of field trials when testing  changes locally. The argument is a param list of (key, value) pairs prefixed  by an associated (trial, group) pair. You specify the param list for multiple  (trial, group) pairs with a comma separator.  Example:    "Trial1.Group1:k1/v1/k2/v2,Trial2.Group2:k3/v3/k4/v4"  Trial names, groups names, parameter names, and value should all be URL  escaped for all non-alphanumeric characters. | kForceFieldTrialParams |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --force-variation-ids |  Forces additional Chrome Variation Ids that will be sent in X-Client-Data  header, specified as a 64-bit encoded list of numeric experiment ids. Ids  prefixed with the character "t" will be treated as Trigger Variation Ids. | kForceVariationIds |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --force-disable-variation-ids |  Forces to remove Chrome Variation Ids from being sent in X-Client-Data  header, specified as a 64-bit encoded list of numeric experiment ids. Ids  prefixed with the character "t" will be treated as Trigger Variation Ids. | kForceDisableVariationIds |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --variations-seed-version |  Used to share variations seed version with child processes. | kVariationsSeedVersion |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --variations-override-country |  Allows overriding the country used for evaluating variations. This is similar  to the "Override Variations Country" entry on chrome:translate-internals,  but is exposed as a command-line flag to allow testing First Run scenarios.  Additionally, unlike chrome:translate-internals, the value isn't persisted  across sessions. | kVariationsOverrideCountry |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --variations-test-seed-path |  Specifies the location of a seed file for Local State's seed to be  populated from. The seed file must be in json format with the keys  |kVariationsCompressedSeed| and |kVariationsSeedSignature|. | kVariationsTestSeedJsonPath |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |
| --variations-server-url |  Specifies a custom URL for the server which reports variation data to the  client. Specifying this switch enables the Variations service on  unofficial builds. See variations_service.cc. | kVariationsServerURL |  | ../chromium/src/components/variations/variations_switches.cc |

| --enable-experimental-cookie-features |  Flag that turns on a group of experimental/newly added cookie-related  features together, as a convenience for e.g. testing, to avoid having to set  multiple switches individually which may be error-prone (not to mention  tedious). There is not a corresponding switch to disable all these features,  because that is discouraged, and for testing purposes you'd need to switch  them off individually to identify the problematic feature anyway.   At present this turns on:    net::features::kSameSiteDefaultChecksMethodRigorously    net::features::kCookieSameSiteConsidersRedirectChain    net::features::kEnablePortBoundCookies    net::features::kEnableSchemeBoundCookies | kEnableExperimentalCookieFeatures |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

This is done in a stable  manner such that the same tests are chosen each run, and under the assumption  that tests hash equally across the range of possible values.  The flag will enable all tracing categories for those tests, and none for the  rest. This flag could be used with other tracing switches like  --enable-tracing-format, but any other switches that will enable tracing will  turn tracing on for all tests. | kEnableTracingFraction |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

| --mojo-local-storage |  Use a Mojo-based LocalStorage implementation. | kMojoLocalStorage |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --no-unsandboxed-zygote |  Disables the unsandboxed zygote.  Note: this flag should not be used on most platforms. It is introduced  because some platforms (e.g. Cast) have very limited memory and binaries  won't be updated when the browser process is running. | kNoUnsandboxedZygote |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --no-zygote |  Disables the use of a zygote process for forking child processes. Instead,  child processes will be forked and exec'd directly. Note that --no-sandbox  should also be used together with this flag because the sandbox needs the  zygote to work. | kNoZygote |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --override-language-detection |  Overrides the language detection result determined based on the page  contents. | kOverrideLanguageDetection |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

| --private-aggregation-developer-mode |  Causes the Private Aggregation API to run without reporting delays. | kPrivateAggregationDeveloperMode |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --process-per-site |  Enable the "Process Per Site" process model for all domains. This mode  consolidates same-site pages so that they share a single process.   More details here:  - https:www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models  - The class comment in site_instance.h, listing the supported process models.   IMPORTANT: This isn't to be confused with --site-per-process (which is about  isolation, not consolidation). You probably want the other one. | kProcessPerSite |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --process-per-tab |  Runs each set of script-connected tabs (i.e., a BrowsingInstance) in its own  renderer process.  We default to using a renderer process for each  site instance (i.e., group of pages from the same registered domain with  script connections to each other).  TODO(creis): This flag is currently a no-op.  We should refactor it to avoid  "unnecessary" process swaps for cross-site navigations but still swap when  needed for security (e.g., isolated origins). | kProcessPerTab |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --type |  The value of this switch determines whether the process is started as a  renderer or plugin host.  If it's empty, it's the browser. | kProcessType |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --protected-audiences-consented-debug-token |  Causes Protected Audiences Bidding and Auction API to supply the provided  debugging key to the trusted auction server. This tells the server that it  okay to log information about this user's auction to help with debugging. | kProtectedAudiencesConsentedDebugToken |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --pull-to-refresh |  Enables or disables pull-to-refresh gesture in response to vertical  overscroll.  Set the value to '0' to disable the feature, set to '1' to enable it for both  touchpad and touchscreen, and set to '2' to enable it only for touchscreen.  Defaults to disabled. | kPullToRefresh |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --quota-change-event-interval |  Specifies the minimum amount of time, in seconds, that must pass before  consecutive quota change events can be fired.

| --renderer-client-id |  | kRendererClientId |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --renderer-cmd-prefix |  The contents of this flag are prepended to the renderer command line.  Useful values might be "valgrind" or "xterm -e gdb --args". | kRendererCmdPrefix |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --renderer |  Causes the process to run as renderer instead of as browser. | kRendererProcess |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --launch-time-ticks |  Time the browser launched the renderer process (in TimeTicks). | kRendererProcessLaunchTimeTicks |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --renderer-process-limit |  Overrides the default/calculated limit to the number of renderer processes.  Very high values for this setting can lead to high memory/resource usage  or instability. | kRendererProcessLimit |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --renderer-startup-dialog |  Causes the renderer process to display a dialog on launch. Passing this flag  also adds sandbox::policy::kNoSandbox on Windows non-official builds, since  that's needed to show a dialog. | kRendererStartupDialog |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --run-manual |  Manual tests only run when --run-manual is specified. This allows writing  tests that don't run automatically but are still in the same test binary.  This is useful so that a team that wants to run a few tests doesn't have to  add a new binary that must be compiled on all builds. | kRunManualTestsFlag |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --sandbox-ipc |  Causes the process to run as a sandbox IPC subprocess. | kSandboxIPCProcess |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

| --single-process |  Runs the renderer and plugins in the same process as the browser | kSingleProcess |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --site-per-process |  Enforces a one-site-per-process security policy:   * Each renderer process, for its whole lifetime, is dedicated to rendering     pages for just one site.   * Thus, pages from different sites are never in the same process.   * A renderer process's access rights are restricted based on its site.   * All cross-site navigations force process swaps.   * <iframe>s are rendered out-of-process whenever the src= is cross-site.   More details here:  - https:www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-isolation  - https:www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/process-models  - The class comment in site_instance.h, listing the supported process models.   IMPORTANT: this isn't to be confused with --process-per-site (which is about  process consolidation, not isolation). You probably want this one. | kSitePerProcess |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --disable-site-isolation-trials |  Disables site isolation.   Note that the opt-in (to site-per-process, isolate-origins, etc.) via  enterprise policy and/or cmdline takes precedence over the  kDisableSiteIsolation switch (i.e. the opt-in takes effect despite potential  presence of kDisableSiteIsolation switch).   Note that for historic reasons the name of the switch misleadingly mentions  "trials", but the switch also disables the default site isolation that ships  on desktop since M67.  The name of the switch is preserved for  backcompatibility of chrome:flags. | kDisableSiteIsolation |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --start-fullscreen |  Specifies if the browser should start in fullscreen mode, like if the user  had pressed F11 right after startup. | kStartFullscreen |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --enable-stats-collection-bindings |  Specifies if the |StatsCollectionController| needs to be bound in the  renderer. This binding happens on per-frame basis and hence can potentially  be a performance bottleneck. One should only enable it when running a test  that needs to access the provided statistics. | kStatsCollectionController |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --skia-font-cache-limit-mb |  Specifies the max number of bytes that should be used by the skia font cache.  If the cache needs to allocate more, skia will purge previous entries. | kSkiaFontCacheLimitMb |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --skia-resource-cache-limit-mb |  Specifies the max number of bytes that should be used by the skia resource  cache. The previous entries are purged from the cache when the memory useage  exceeds this limit. | kSkiaResourceCacheLimitMb |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

| --use-fake-ui-for-fedcm |  Bypass the FedCM account selection dialog. If a value is provided for  this switch, that account ID is selected, otherwise the first account  is chosen. | kUseFakeUIForFedCM |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --use-fake-ui-for-media-stream |  Bypass the media stream infobar by selecting the default device for media  streams (e.g. WebRTC). Works with --use-fake-device-for-media-stream.  Prefer --auto-accept-camera-and-microphone-capture which does not interact  with screen/tab capture. | kUseFakeUIForMediaStream |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --use-skia-font-manager |  This will replace the existing font manager with SkiaFontManager in the  renderer. | kUseSkiaFontManager | BUILDFLAG(IS_WIN) | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

| --wait-for-debugger-on-navigation |  On every navigation a message with the renderer's URL will be logged and the  renderer will wait for a debugger to be attached or SIGUSR1 to be sent to  continue execution. | kWaitForDebuggerOnNavigation |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --wait-for-debugger-webui |  Flag used by WebUI test runners to wait for debugger to be attached. | kWaitForDebuggerWebUI |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --webauthn-remote-desktop-support |  Allows trusted remote desktop clients to make WebAuthn requests on behalf of  other origins. This switch only controls availability of the  `remoteDesktopClientOverride` extension but doesn't by itself enable any  origin to use it. | kWebAuthRemoteDesktopSupport |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --webgl-antialiasing-mode |  Set the antialiasing method used for webgl. (none, explicit, implicit) | kWebglAntialiasingMode |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --webgl-msaa-sample-count |  Set a default sample count for webgl if msaa is enabled. | kWebglMSAASampleCount |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

| --no-xr-runtime |  Tell WebXr to assume that it does not support any runtimes. | kWebXrRuntimeNone |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --orientation-sensors |  | kWebXrRuntimeOrientationSensors |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --arcore |  The following are the runtimes that WebXr supports. | kWebXrRuntimeArCore |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --cardboard |  | kWebXrRuntimeCardboard |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --openxr |  | kWebXrRuntimeOpenXr |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --disable-media-session-api |  Disable Media Session API | kDisableMediaSessionAPI | BUILDFLAG(IS_ANDROID) | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

| --enable-automation |  Enable indication that browser is controlled by automation. | kEnableAutomation |  | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --prevent-resizing-contents-for-testing |  For mobile devices, tests should include a viewport meta tag to specify page  dimension adjustments. Omitting the tag can lead to automatic resizing to  the standard mobile fallback size (980), which results in content shrinking  as it first expands to 980, then scales down to 800 to fit the screen, as  observed in the issue at https:crrev.com/c/4615623.  This flag is intended for use in tests that do not include a viewport meta  tag. When enabled, it ensures the viewport size matches the standard mobile  fallback size, thereby helping to prevent content resizing in such tests. | kPreventResizingContentsForTesting | BUILDFLAG(IS_IOS) | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |
| --enable-speech-dispatcher |  Allows sending text-to-speech requests to speech-dispatcher, a common  Linux speech service. Because it's buggy, the user must explicitly  enable it so that visiting a random webpage can't cause instability. | kEnableSpeechDispatcher | BUILDFLAG(IS_LINUX) || BUILDFLAG(IS_CHROMEOS_LACROS) | ../chromium/src/content/public/common/content_switches.cc |

| --use-file-for-fake-audio-capture |  Play a .wav file as the microphone. Note that for WebRTC calls we'll treat  the bits as if they came from the microphone, which means you should disable  audio processing (lest your audio file will play back distorted). The input  file is converted to suit Chrome's audio buses if necessary, so most sane  .wav files should work. You can pass either <path> to play the file looping  or <path>%noloop to stop after playing the file to completion.   Must also be used with kDisableAudioInput or kUseFakeDeviceForMediaStream. | kUseFileForFakeAudioCapture |  | ../chromium/src/media/base/media_switches.cc |

| --override-hardware-secure-codecs-for-testing |  Overrides hardware secure codecs support for testing. If specified, real  platform hardware secure codecs check will be skipped. Valid codecs are:  - video: "vp8", "vp9", "avc1", "hevc", "dolbyvision", "av01"  - video that does not support clear lead: `<video>-no-clearlead`, where    <video> is from the list above.  - audio: "mp4a", "vorbis"  Codecs are separated by comma. For example:   --override-hardware-secure-codecs-for-testing=vp8,vp9-no-clearlead,vorbis   --override-hardware-secure-codecs-for-testing=avc1,mp4a  CENC encryption scheme is assumed to be supported for the specified codecs.  If no valid codecs specified, no hardware secure codecs are supported.

| --disable-video-capture-use-gpu-memory-buffer |  This is for the same feature controlled by kVideoCaptureUseGpuMemoryBuffer.  kVideoCaptureUseGpuMemoryBuffer is settled by chromeos overlays. This flag is  necessary to overwrite the settings via chrome: flag. The behavior of  chrome:flag#zero-copy-video-capture is as follows;  Default  : Respect chromeos overlays settings.  Enabled  : Force to enable kVideoCaptureUseGpuMemoryBuffer.  Disabled : Force to disable kVideoCaptureUseGpuMemoryBuffer. | kDisableVideoCaptureUseGpuMemoryBuffer |  | ../chromium/src/media/capture/capture_switches.cc |
